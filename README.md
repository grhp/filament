This repo exists to serve a recent WebGL build of
[Filament](https://github.com/google/filament) to the following URL:

https://grhp.github.io/filament

The `update.py` script in this repo can be used to download the latest build artifact and update
the `public` folder.

The `serve.py` script makes it easy to serve the demos locally during development.
